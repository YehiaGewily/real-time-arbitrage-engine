# Note: The provided Flink image has PyFlink libs in /opt/flink/opt/python usually, 
# but installing via pip ensures the python environment has it for the submitter script if it imports it.
# However, 'flink run' uses the bundled flink dist. 
# We'll just stick to the producer deps for now to keep it light, unless processor.py needs them.
